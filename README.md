#Crawling Twitter data : Public tweets using Twitter Handle
1. Pass a twitter handle as an input parameter for which the public tweets needs to be retrived
Note: Twitter handle starts with "@" .For example : @Test - Here Twitter handle name is Test
2. Depending upon the project requirements, one can choose either some or all of the following in the code.
Tweet ID, Text, isRetweet,time, replies,retweets,likes,entries.
In this repository, I am going to retrive all of the fields tagged to a particular tweet.
3. Post retrival, I am writing it into a csv after parsing the data into required format.

Happy Coding,
Sindhu.
